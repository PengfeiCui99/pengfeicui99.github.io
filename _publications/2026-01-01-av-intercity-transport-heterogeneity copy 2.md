abstract: "The substantial difference in mass and stiffness between trucks and cars often leads to severe injuries in truck-car crashes. This study aims to jointly analyze the injury severity of truck and car drivers in truck-car crashes while accounting for the correlation between their injury levels and unobserved heterogeneity. Crash data from California (2015–2019) were utilized. A correlated random parameters bivariate probit model with heterogeneity in means (CRPBPHM) was developed. The results show a significant correlation between the injury severity of truck and car drivers in the same crash. The model identified multilayer unobserved heterogeneity in the effects of contributing factors. Specifically, random parameters such as lighting, road surface, and crash type were found to vary across observations, and their means were further influenced by other variables like temporal characteristics and location. The study highlights that factors such as unsafe speed, improper turning, and alcohol involvement significantly increase the probability of severe injuries for both drivers. The proposed model outperforms traditional models in goodness-of-fit, offering a deeper understanding of the complex injury mechanisms in truck-car crashes and providing a theoretical basis for formulating management measures to improve safety."
