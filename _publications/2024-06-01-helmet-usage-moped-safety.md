abstract: "Mopeds are a widely used mode of transport in developing countries, yet moped riders face significant safety risks compared to other road users. Understanding the factors contributing to injury severity, particularly the role of protective gear like helmets, is crucial for improving road safety. This study investigates the determinants of injury severity in moped-vehicle crashes, with a specific focus on the mitigating effects of helmet usage. Utilizing an extensive dataset of 7,358 moped-vehicle crashes from Fujian Province, China (2015-2020), this research applies a partial proportional odds (PPO) model with random parameters to rigorously account for unobserved heterogeneity in crash data. [cite_start]The results demonstrate that helmet usage significantly reduces the likelihood of severe injuries and fatalities[cite: 14, 21]. [cite_start]Specifically, the protective effect of helmets is found to be heterogeneous, offering substantial benefits to male riders, riders over 60 years old, and those carrying passengers[cite: 22]. [cite_start]Conversely, risky behaviors such as speeding, drunk driving, and running red lights are strongly correlated with higher injury severity[cite: 22]. [cite_start]The study further reveals that adverse environmental conditions, such as poor lighting and bad weather, exacerbate risks for non-helmeted riders[cite: 22]. These findings provide empirical evidence to support targeted traffic safety policies, emphasizing strict helmet enforcement and tailored educational programs for high-risk demographic groups to mitigate injury outcomes in moped accidents."
