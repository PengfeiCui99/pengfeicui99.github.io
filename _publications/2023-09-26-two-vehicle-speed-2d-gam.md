abstract: "This study investigates how the paired speeds of two vehicles jointly shape the risk of serious injury in intersection crashes. Using 2016–2018 two-vehicle intersection crash records from the U.S. Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS), we move beyond conventional one-dimensional ‘impact speed’ formulations and model crash risk as a smooth, non-parametric function of both the striking (impact) and struck (impacted) vehicle speeds. We develop a two-dimensional additive logistic regression within a generalized additive modeling framework, implemented via a tensor-product thin-plate spline smooth, and benchmark it against a traditional additive logistic model based on impact speed. The proposed two-dimensional model yields improved fit and reveals nuanced, crash-type-specific risk surfaces. For head-on crashes, risk in the medium-speed region is driven primarily by the faster vehicle, with limited sensitivity to the slower vehicle. For angle and rear crashes, the marginal relationship between the two vehicle speeds and serious injury risk is non-monotonic, implying that increases in one vehicle’s speed may, under certain regimes, reduce injury risk by altering speed differentials and evasive-response capacity. The findings support differentiated countermeasures across speed regimes, including avoiding exceedingly low-speed intersection traversal, enhancing medium-speed emergency response assistance, and reinforcing high-speed warnings and control."
